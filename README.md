# Recipe App with React Native and Expo

This project is a Recipe App built using React Native and Expo. It allows users to browse through a collection of recipes, view detailed information about each recipe, and like their favorite recipes for future reference.

## Technologies Used

1. React Native with Expo
2. [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
3. [React-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
4. [Native Wind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)
5. AsyncStorage (for storing images locally)
6. Axios (for fetching recipe data from an API)
7. React Native Youtube Iframe (to integrate the youtube video in app)
8. React Native Heroicons (for the icons)

Database for Meals: [themealsdb](https://www.themealdb.com/)
